Literature Review
The field of text recognition has seen significant advancements over the years, driven by improvements in computer vision, optical character recognition (OCR), and machine learning techniques. This section provides an overview of existing text recognition systems, the underlying technologies, and the challenges they address.
1. Overview of Existing Text Recognition Systems
Text recognition systems are widely used in applications such as document digitization, license plate recognition, and assistive technologies. Traditional OCR systems were primarily rule-based, relying on predefined templates and character shapes. While effective for structured inputs, these systems struggled with variability in font styles, sizes, and distortions.
Modern OCR systems, such as Google’s Tesseract-OCR, have significantly improved accuracy and adaptability by incorporating machine learning algorithms. These systems can recognize text in various languages, handle noisy or low-quality images, and work across different layouts.
2. Key Technologies and Approaches
•	Optical Character Recognition (OCR):
OCR is the core technology used in text recognition. Open-source tools like Tesseract-OCR leverage neural networks to analyze and decode characters from images.
•	Image Processing Techniques:
Libraries such as OpenCV facilitate preprocessing tasks like binarization, noise reduction, and edge detection, which are crucial for enhancing text clarity in images.


3. Challenges in Text Recognition
•	Noise and Low Resolution:
Text embedded in noisy or low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. Blurring, shadow effects, and distortion require robust preprocessing techniques to improve recognition accuracy.
•	Font Variability:
Different font styles, sizes, and orientations complicate text detection. Dynamic systems must account for these variations to ensure reliable recognition.
•	Real-Time Performance:
Processing and recognizing text in real-time adds an additional layer of complexity. Efficient algorithms and optimized code are essential for minimizing latency without sacrificing accuracy.


4. Relevance to the Current Project
